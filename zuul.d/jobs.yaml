      The base job for OpenStack's installation of Zuul.

      All jobs ultimately inherit from this.  It runs a pre-playbook
      which copies all of the job's prepared git repos on to all of
      the nodes in the nodeset.  It runs a post-playbook which copies
      all of the files in the logs/ subdirectory of the executor
      work directory to the logserver.

      It also sets default timeout and nodeset values (which may be
      overidden).

      Responds to these variables:

      .. zuul:jobvar:: base_serial
         :default: Omitted

         This sets the serial keyword in the pre and post playbooks
         which can be an integer or percentage.
